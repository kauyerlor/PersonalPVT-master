# PersonalPVT

PersonalPVT is a Web application that supports Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) testing. This is a kind of
test that is widely used by psychologists for quantifying sleepiness. When we are tired, we will nod off
 for short periods (scientists call it "micro-sleep"). This test is designed to catch those moments if 
they are occurring. They will manifest as a slowing of reflexes.

Usually, testers in studies will have to take a ten-minute test as many as 6 times a day. But I think you can still get interesting 
data even if you only take the test once or twice a day.

The application is available at http://luketurner.org/PersonalPVT
